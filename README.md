# Algorithm To Calculate Prize Structure For Tournaments(i.e. poker, lottery etc.)

This is an algorithm that I designed for the mobile app Winerz, they required an algorithm to calculate the payout structure for in-app tournaments. This program utilizes the methodology put forth in the paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04203.pdf. Utilizing this power law method allows us to create the ideal incentive structure.
